# Feature Roadmap: Start a New Game (Initialization)

## Overview

Initialize a new Tic Tac Toe game so players can begin play. Establish an empty 3x3 board, mark all positions as available, and set the current player to X with an initial display.

## System View

Domain module creates initial game state; any user interface may present it. The domain remains UI-agnostic and I/O-free.

## Spec references

- User Story + BDD scenarios: specification-package/tictactoe-bdd-specification-package.md
  - Scenario: Initialize empty board
  - Scenario: Display initial board

## Test Scenario Sequence

> Focus on behavior (what), not implementation (how)

1. Initialize empty board: new game returns an empty 3x3 board, all 9 positions available, current player is X.
2. Display initial board: viewing immediately after start shows a 3x3 grid labeled 1-9 with no marks.

## Boundaries & Dependencies

- **External Systems**: None for unit tests; UI handled separately in integration tests
- **Internal Patterns**: Pure functions; keep state creation pure, isolate side effects in UI layer
- **Integration Points**: A UI layer (CLI/GUI/web) may present the state; domain tests stay pure

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Clear, readable initial board presentation suitable for the chosen UI

## Notes

- Tests will assert behavior (empty, available, X starts) without prescribing data structures
- Avoid coupling tests to rendering format beyond essentials for readability
