Analyze the issue, scan relevant files, optionally consult docs, summarize next steps. Stop.

I repeat: DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE AFTER THE COMMAND:

1. Analyze issue or task at hand
2. Research any relevant files for context
   a. Optional: use the web tool for documentation
3. Analyze how to solve it or how to move forward
4. Report back with your findings
5. STOP. DON'T CHANGE, ADD, OR DELETE ANYTHING.
