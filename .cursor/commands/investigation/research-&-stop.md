# Research & Stop

Research the codebase and relevant documentation to gather context for the current task. Stop when complete.

**IMPORTANT: READ-ONLY RESEARCH ONLY. DO NOT MODIFY, CREATE, OR DELETE ANY FILES OR CODE WHEN RESEARCHING.**

## Instructions

1. **Search Codebase**

   - Find existing patterns, components, or implementations related to the task
   - Locate relevant utility functions, types, interfaces, or shared code
   - Find similar features or test examples that can guide the work
   - Identify architectural patterns and conventions being used

2. **Search Documentation** (when relevant)

   - Look up official documentation for frameworks/libraries being used
   - Find best practices for the current approach
   - Research API documentation or technical specifications
   - Use web search tool if needed

3. **Report Findings**

   - Summarize relevant patterns and code found
   - Highlight existing implementations to reference or extend
   - Note important constraints, conventions, or decisions
   - Provide links to helpful documentation
   - Recommend next steps

4. **STOP**
   - Wait for user review and direction

## Usage Throughout AAID: Augmented AI Development

- **Stage 1 (Context)**: Gather broad project patterns and architecture
- **Stage 2 (Planning)**: Research specific approaches for the planned feature
- **Stage 4 (TDD)**: Research implementation approaches, testing patterns, or debug issues
- **General Development**: Investigate APIs, libraries, or solve specific problems

Note: If AAID development rules don't seem to be available, request them for full workflow context.
