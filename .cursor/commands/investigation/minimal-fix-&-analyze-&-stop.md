Implement the simplest and cleanest fix, analyze and research any relevant files for context, then verify if the fix was successful or not, report back then STOP.

I repeat: DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE AFTER THE COMMAND:

1. Research any relevant files for context
2. Implement the cleanest and simplest fix
3. Verify success or failure of the fix by running tests and/or code
4. Analyze result
5. Report back with your findings
6. STOP. DON'T CHANGE, ADD, OR DELETE ANYTHING.
