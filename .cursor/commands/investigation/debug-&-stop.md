Debug and research any relevant files for context, report back then STOP.

I repeat: DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE AFTER THE COMMAND:

1. Add debug logs
2. Research any relevant files for context
   a. Optional: use the web tool for documentation
3. Run the command necessary to analyze the logs
4. Report back with your findings
5. STOP. DON'T CHANGE, ADD, OR DELETE ANYTHING.
